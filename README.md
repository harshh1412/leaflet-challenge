# leaflet-challenge

I've only done Part 1 of this assignment. I've also deployed it on GitHub Pages (https://harshh1412.github.io/leaflet-challenge/). The script for this webpage is in the static/js folder, named "logic.js". It is thoroughly commented to showcase the logic/purpose of the commands used.
